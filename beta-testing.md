# Capstone Project Beta Testing
## Project Name: Tic Tac Toe
## Group Members: Luke

-------------------------------------
~~~ Programmer Feedback done first ~~~


## Non-Programmer Feedback (Name: Kirby-(Dad)) 
### Programs/Issues that occurred while testing:
- If there is no winner then board becomes completely full with no clear
- Overlapping of X's and O's
- No case for the game resulting in a draw

### What is your general thoughts and feedback about the program?
Likes process of code, overlapping of images is the most disruptive bug

### Coding Team - What we did in response to this feedback?
- Created an array called "Is Populated" to check if certain squares are taken -> Overlapping is fixed
- Created a case and message for the game resulting in a draw which can be clear by pressing 'c'

-------------------------------------
## External Programmer Feedback (Name: Chase) 
### Programs/Issues that occurred while testing:
- Didn't understand clear function at first, maybe more visible clear rather than in console
- If you do not immediately clear, the wins of each player pile up ridiculously 
- Overlapping images of X's and O's.

### What is your general thoughts and feedback about the program?
Generally enjoyed the project, no major gripes or criticisms.

### Coding Team - What we did in response to this feedback?
- Added an automatic clear function when game is won -> Game automatically ends after win
- Capitalizing instructions and  '~' characters to stand out

-------------------------------------
## Coding Team - Known Bugs, Glitches, Issues
- Overlapping of X's and O's 
- Back to back wins
